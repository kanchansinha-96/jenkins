Error:- 

 --> Finished Dependency Resolution  
 Error: Package: jenkins-2.303.1-1.1.noarch (jenkins)  
       Requires: daemonize  
  You could try using --skip-broken to work around the problem  
  You could try running: rpm -Va --nofiles --nodigest  
Cause:-
Basically daemonize runs a command as a Daemon in the Centos. Since the package is missing in the version of the Centos you running thats why this error is coming. Think of it like a dependency which is required by the Jenkins to run but since you missing on the Daemonize thats why its giving the error.

Resolution:-
Daemonize doesn't ship in the default repository thats why yum is not able to resolve it. You will need to install the Daemonize from the Epel repository which is the extra package for enterprise linux as

 # yum install epel-release -y  
 # yum install daemonize -y  
 Than you can continue on installing the Jenkins as  
 # yum install jenkins -y  
 
 We will be using open java for our demo, Get the latest version from http://openjdk.java.net/install/

yum install java-1.8*
#yum -y install java-1.8.0-openjdk-devel
Confirm Java Version and set the java home

java -version
find /usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8* | head -n 3
JAVA_HOME=/usr/lib/jvm/java-1.8.0-openjdk-<Java version which seen in the above output>
export JAVA_HOME
PATH=$PATH:$JAVA_HOME
 # To set it permanently update your .bash_profile
vi ~/.bash_profile
The output should be something like this,

[root@~]# java -version
openjdk version "1.8.0_151"
OpenJDK Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_151-b12)
OpenJDK 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.151-b12, mixed mode)
Install Jenkins
You can install jenkins using the rpm or by setting up the repo. We will set up the repo so that we can update it easily in the future.

Get the latest version of jenkins from https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/ and install

yum -y install wget
sudo wget -O /etc/yum.repos.d/jenkins.repo https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.repo
sudo rpm --import https://pkg.jenkins.io/redhat-stable/jenkins.io.key
 # yum install epel-release -y  
 # yum install daemonize -y  
 Than you can continue on installing the Jenkins as  
 # yum install jenkins -y 
yum -y install jenkins
Start Jenkins
# Start jenkins service
service jenkins start

# Setup Jenkins to start at boot,
chkconfig jenkins on
